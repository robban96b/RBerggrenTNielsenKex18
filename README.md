### Code directory
All files used to run the tests are placed in the code directory.

### Original code
The original code is located in the path: code/orginalCode/"algorithmName"

### Edited code
The edited code is located in the path:
code/"algorithmName"

### Input data
The input data is located in the path:
code/data/

### Run code
Individual algorithms can be run by going to the Makefile in code/ and choose the wanted algorithm for the PATHVAR (row 10-19)

All algorithms can be run through the run.sh file. Time and Individual run settings can be edited in run.sh file.

### Results in details
Results in deep details for each algorithm can be found in their respective directory.

### Results summary
The resultReader.cpp can be compiled and run with a result file as input, the output will be a file with the same name as input with added "sum" to it. That file will contain a summary about the input result file.
